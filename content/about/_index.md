I'm a web developer currently located in Oakland, California. I specialize in improving customer support workflows using [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/). My current interests include building [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org) sites on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and making Raspberry Pis do my bidding.

You can find my work in my [GitHub](https://github.com/jpalmieri) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/jpalmieri/) profiles, check out my activity on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3376769/jpalmieri), or see my work experience on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephpalmieri/).

When I'm not staring at a computer screen, I enjoy spinning fire, playing my ukulele, creating industrial art, and brewing beer.

If you're really curious, you can read my extended [bio](/about/bio).
